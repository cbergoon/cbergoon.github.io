The Go Load Balancer [glb](http://github.com/cbergoon/glb) project is a simple reverse proxy. It can be used as both a load balancer for a single service and/or as a multiple host reverse proxy. The load balancer implements a round robbin balancing with settings for connecton TTL to manipulate the operation and efficiency of the balancer based on the use case. There is a built in registry used to store the service data and other relevant settings.
